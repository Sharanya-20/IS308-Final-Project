# IS308-Final-Project
Project Repository for IS 308 Final project on 'Analysis of Gender and Racial Bias in ChatGPT's Image Generation'


## Overview
This project aims to investigate the presence of gender bias in AI-generated images of various professional roles. By providing specific prompts to an AI model capable of generating human-like images, we explore whether the generated images conform to or challenge common gender stereotypes associated with professional roles. The analysis focuses on comparing the expected gender, based on societal biases, with the gender depicted in AI-generated images for each professional role.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises AI-generated images corresponding to different professional roles. Each image is associated with metadata including the professional role, perceived gender, generated gender, and additional attributes such as race or ethnicity. The dataset is available in the main project repository and is accompanied by an 'images' folder containing all the images that we obtained through ChatGPT. 

## Analysis
The analysis follows a structured methodology encompassing data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and comparison of expected vs. generated genders within the 'project_report.ipynb' Python notebook in the project repository. Visualization techniques such as heatmaps and pie charts are employed to analyze the data and gain insights into the distribution of genders across professional roles. The findings are discussed in the context of ethical considerations surrounding AI technologies.
